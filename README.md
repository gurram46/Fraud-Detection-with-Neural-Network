### **Project Description**
This project demonstrates the process of building a fraud detection model using a neural network. The steps include data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and prediction. The model's performance is evaluated using metrics such as AUC-ROC. The dataset used in this project is from a Kaggle competition.

### **Installation**
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.

### **Usage**
1. Data Preprocessing:
   - Feature Engineering
   - Apply IQR Treatment
   - Handle Missing Values
   - Scale the Features
   - Split the Data

2. Train the Model:
   - Use the neural network to train on the preprocessed data.

3. Make Predictions:
   - Generate predictions using the trained model on the test data.

### **Model Training**
Detailed steps on how the model is trained, including the architecture and training parameters.

### **Prediction**
Steps to make predictions on the test data, including handling the test dataset and generating binary predictions for fraud detection.

### **Results**
The model's performance is evaluated using the AUC-ROC score. Additional evaluation metrics and visualizations are provided to assess the model's effectiveness.
